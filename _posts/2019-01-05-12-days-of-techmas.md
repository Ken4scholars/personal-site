During the Christmas holiday, I collected my own version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_(song)" target="\_blank">
12 days of Christmas</a> each day. Actually I have 13 instead of 12, but oh well, you will find out why.
While many of them are based on my activities on each of those days, some are just generic tech stuff. 

The idea to create the full song popped up after I had incidentally created my own version for the first 2 days and discovered
it would be interesting to create the full song. 

And yeah, when I thought about the naming, I first considered _DevMas_ before _TechMas._ Yes, you're right, DevMas definitely
sounds awful. It kinda sounds like _DevilMas_ which is like the opposite of what Christmas should be. Sheesh!:cold_sweat:

So anyway, I ended up going with _TechMas_ and thought voila! what a great name I have come up with, only 
to check on the 8th day and find out there are tons of _12 days of TechMas_ out there!:disappointed:
Nevertheless, this version is still unique in it's own way though, so let's get down to it.
 
> On the -1th day of Christmas, my true love sent to me...IndexOutOfRangeException!

Great Christmas Eve I had there, right?
 
> On the first day of Christmas, my true love sent to me...'RussianType' December has no attribute 'Christmas'!

Yeah, I live in Russia and this is very true!

> On the second day of Christmas, my true love sent to me...Not enough values to unpack! (expected many, got none)

Ever tried to unpack an empty tuple in Python? That's exactly what happened to me on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_Day" target="\_blank">boxing day</a>
when I tried to open the non-existent boxes
 
> On the third day of Christmas, my true love sent to me...Three fresh compile errors!

I definitely would have preferred French hens, but oh well.

> On the 4th day of Christmas, my true love sent to me...'Bird' object has no attribute call!

The OP may fancy birds being able to call but OOP begs to defer, if you know what I mean:satisfied:

> On the 5th day of Christmas, my true love sent to me...The one golden perceptron to rule them all!

Any ML gurus/Tolkien's fans in the house? My true love finally gave me something good! a perfectly trained model!
I bet like me, most people only remember the gift on the 5th day. Kinda has a _ring_ to it!

> On the 6th day of Christmas, my ReLu sent to me...6 juicy layers!

_Geese!_ My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)" target="\_blank">rectifier</a>  be _slaying!_

> On the 7th day of Christmas, my true love sent to me...7 docker swarms!

Any DevOps in the house? Go green! go microservices! swim in a pool of docker containers like Swans! Kuber fans are also welcome:smiley:

> On the 8th day of Christmas, my true love sent to me...ValueError: expected an object of type 'Christmas', got NewYear!

Hurray, 2018 has been _milked_ dry and it's now 2019! Those maids though:joy:

> On the 9th day of Christmas, my true love sent to me...9 ladybugs dancing!

Bugs, bugs and bugs again. Instead of ladies dancing I got huge ladybugs dancing

> On the 10th day of Christmas, my true love sent to me...EndOfHoliday(EOH) error!

And my holiday unexpectedly came to an end, like a File stream. Had to go back to work:weary:

> On the 1th day of Christmas, my true love sent to me...The Pied Piper Compression algorithm!

_Hooli sh*t!_ thanks love, for the great gift! I bet you never knew <a href="http://www.piedpiper.com/" target="\_blank">Pied piper</a> existed.
I am off to the Valley to join the pipers!

> On the 12th day of Christmas, my true love sent to me...Segmentation Fault!

SegFault damn! Looks like my days array is finally out of bound. I'm out!
