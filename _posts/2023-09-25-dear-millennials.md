<i>
Dear Millenials, <br>
Born amidst the digital revolution's gleam,<br>
A world at your fingertips, it feels like a dream.<br>
But with screens as companions by your side,<br>
Do you sometimes wonder what's been denied?
</i>

<i>
In virtual realms, you dwell so deep,<br>
A life lived online, you silently weep.<br>
Connections lost to likes and shares,<br>
The art of conversation, it wears and tears.
</i>

<i>
Born into this modern age,<br>
You seek solace in a digital stage.<br>
Yet, in the physical, something's amiss,<br>
Longing for touch, for a warm embrace.
</i>

<i>
Out there, they fear you lack,<br>
The grit and strength to stay on track.<br>
In a world of instant gratification,<br>
Do you lose sight of long-term dedication?
</i>

<i>
Dear Millennials, burdened by loans,<br>
While chasing dreams, the cost dethrones.<br>
Education's key becomes a lock,<br>
As debts accumulate, like a ticking clock.
</i>

<i>
Expensive housing, another plight,<br>
Inflated markets, a formidable fight.<br>
Dreams of owning a place to call home,<br>
In a world where property prices roam.
</i>

<i>
You signed the dotted line,<br>
Unaware of the chains that would entwine.<br>
Student loans, they beckoned with allure,<br>
Promising futures that seemed secure.
</i>

<i>
Yet as you graduated with degrees,<br>
You faced a reality that brought you to your knees.<br>
In a job market that played hide and seek,<br>
Your dreams and aspirations felt too weak.
</i>

<i>
Dear Millennials under pressure and constant strain,<br>
Anxiety and depression leave their stain.<br>
The weight of expectations takes its toll,<br>
As you navigate through life's complex role.
</i>

<i>
Relationships, too, become a test,<br>
In a world where connection's often stressed.<br>
With screens and distance in between,<br>
Authentic bonds may not be as keen.
</i>

<i>
In the pursuit of love and affection,<br>
You face challenges that beg reflection.<br>
Communication, a dance of fears,<br>
Misunderstandings, shedding tears.
</i>

<i>
Dear Millennials,<br>
Amidst the struggle, your generation lies,<br>
Caught between two different skies.<br>
Baby boomers, with a world now past,<br>
Look back at life's journey, and shadows cast.
</i>

<i>
Gen-Z, on the horizon bright,<br>
Navigates life with fresh insight.<br>
As Millennials bridge the gap between,<br>
The past and future is unforeseen.
</i>

<i>
But amidst these doubts and naysayers' cries,<br>
Dear Millennials, you still rise.<br>
For you've harnessed technology's might,<br>
To fight for justice and shine a light.
</i>

<i>
The older generation may cast their doubts,<br>
But they, too, once faced their own bouts.<br>
In every age, there are concerns and fears,<br>
Yet through it all, progress appears.
</i>

<i>
Thanks Millennials, for taking a stand,<br>
Empowering change with your demands.<br>
Advocating for justice and equality,<br>
You shape a future with tenacity.
</i>

<i>
With open minds and hearts that care,<br>
You tackle global issues, be it anywhere.<br>
Climate change, social justice, and more,<br>
Your activism echoes shore to shore.
</i>

<i>
Let's raise our glasses to my generation,<br>
For we've faced hardships with determination.<br>
Dear Millennials, together we'll find the way,<br>
To break free from the grip of loans, we pray.<br>
</i>
