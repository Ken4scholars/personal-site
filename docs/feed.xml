				<title>2022 Book Reviews</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Last year I published an &lt;a href=&quot;/books/2021/12/31/2021-book-reviews.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; reviewing some of the books I had read and found interesting
during the year. End-of-year recaps have become increasingly popular in various aspects including business and personal
life. Hence, I have decided to make the book reviews an annual tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>2021 Book Reviews</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;It was the second year of COVID-19, it was the year of intensified conflicts in Afghanistan, it was the year of the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNmYA75x9gE&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;Ezza/Effium crisis&lt;/a&gt; among communities in 
Ohaukwu LGA of Ebonyi state in South Eastern Nigeria which led to the death and displacement of many families including mine.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Robot Laws: Reloaded</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;First of all, let me tell you - I do not like to wake up early. In the rare occasions when I do, it is usually out of a great
necessity. You may wonder what those necessities are, like say, for work? But that is a topic for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Django Post-save Signal in a Transaction</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;So let’s assume you have this cool Django project that uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/signals/&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;signals&lt;/a&gt;
to achieve loose coupling between different parts of your code and across apps. There’s been
quite a lot of arguments against signals but you will agree with me that it does make things
clean especially when it comes to communication across apps. The major argument against it being
that it makes code less readable as it is not readily obvious where some action is performed 
after a signal is fired. This is quite true, especially when you start working on an existing project 
and you have to navigate through the code to find out where a particular functionality is implemented.
Direct function calls are usually more obvious and readable but can also lead to too much dependency and coupling
between different parts of your code. The Django signals system is an implementation of the popular
&lt;a href=&quot;https://abdulapopoola.com/2013/03/12/design-patterns-pub-sub-explained/&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;publisher/subscriber&lt;/a&gt; (or just pubsub) design pattern
so it is actually nothing new nor is it limited to the framework. The issue is that because most of popular signals (say hello to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/signals/#django.db.models.signals.post_save&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;post_save&lt;/a&gt;)
are inbuilt and triggered by the framework, it is usually not obvious when they are used because it is not visible in your code.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>12 Days Of TechMas</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;During the Christmas holiday, I collected my own version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_(song)&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;
12 days of Christmas&lt;/a&gt; each day. Actually I have 13 instead of 12, but oh well, you will find out why.
While many of them are based on my activities on each of those days, some are just generic tech stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Django Generic Relation - multi usage in the same model</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;If you have developed web services using &lt;a href=&quot;https://djangoproject.com&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;Django,&lt;/a&gt; chances are that you 
have come across the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/contrib/contenttypes/#generic-relations&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;Generic Relations.&lt;/a&gt;
It is a technique that allows you to link a model with multiple other models without knowing them before hand. It comes 
in quite handy when you have common traits which can be applied to several models. A typical example is a &lt;em&gt;tagging&lt;/em&gt; system
which is used as an example in the docs.&lt;/p&gt;
